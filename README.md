This dataset consists of bike sales that occured around three different regions. Various metrics such as gender, marital status, age, profession, income, house ownership, commute distance, and car ownerships have been included.
This dashboard can effectively help us understand the buying tendancies of customers. We can analyse how different metrics influence their buying decisions.
